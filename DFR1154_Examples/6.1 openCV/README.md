This example mainly demonstrates the implementation of object contour recognition using OpenCV on the computer side.

**Steps**

1. Burn the code to the module (use the code from Section 5.3 or 5.4).
2. Install the Python environment (https://www.python.org/). Skip this step if Python is already installed.
3. Install the opencv-python library:
   - Press Win+R, type "cmd" to open the command prompt.
   - Enter "pip install opencv-python" to install the library.
4. Open Python's IDLE, go to File -> Open..., and select the Python file (use `openCV_5_3.py` for the Section 5.3 example or `openCV_5_4.py` for the Section 5.4 example). In the new window that appears, press F5 to view the output.

Please note:

- When using `openCV_5_3.py`, please remember to modify the IP address parameter.
- When using `openCV_5_4.py`, please remember to adjust the `camera_index` parameter.
